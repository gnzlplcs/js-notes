# spread operator

this operator is a new ES6 feature. the _spread_ operator allow us to make a copy of all array's elements, like `.slice()` method without parameters.

the spread syntax is: `...`.

## syntax

```plain
[...iterableObj, '4', 'five', 6]; // combine two arrays by inserting all elements from iterableObj
```
